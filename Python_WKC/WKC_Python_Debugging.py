# Debugging Best Practices in Python:
# 1. Use print() statements

# 2. Use the Python debugger (pdb)
# The Python debugger (pdb) is a powerful tool that allows you to step through
# your code line by line, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions. You can
# start the debugger by adding the following line to your code:
# import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
# This will pause the execution of your code at that point and drop you into
# the debugger prompt. From there, you can use various commands to navigate
# through your code and debug any issues.

# 3. Use logging
# The logging module in Python provides a flexible and powerful way to log
# messages from your code. You can use different logging levels (e.g., DEBUG,
# INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to categorize your log messages and control
# their verbosity. You can also configure logging to write messages to different
# destinations, such as the console, a file, or a network socket.


# 4. Use assertions
# Assertions are statements that check if a condition is true and raise an
# AssertionError if it is not. You can use assertions to check for conditions
# that should always be true in your code. For example:
# x = 10
# assert x > 0, "x should be greater than 0"
# This will raise an AssertionError if x is not greater than 0.

# 5. Use a linter
# A linter is a tool that analyzes your code for potential errors, style issues,
# and other problems. It can help you catch common mistakes and improve the
# overall quality of your code. Some popular Python linters include pylint,
# flake8, and black.

# 6. Use a code formatter
# A code formatter is a tool that automatically formats your code according to
# a set of predefined rules. It can help you maintain a consistent coding style
# and make your code more readable. Some popular Python code formatters include
# black, autopep8, and yapf.

# 7. Use version control
# Version control systems like Git allow you to track changes to your code,
# collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed. By using
# version control, you can keep a history of your code changes and easily
# manage different versions of your project.

# 8. Use unit tests
# Unit tests are small, automated tests that verify the behavior of individual
# components (e.g., functions, classes) in your code. By writing unit tests, you
# can ensure that your code works as expected and catch regressions when making
# changes. You can use the built-in unittest module or third-party libraries
# like pytest to write and run unit tests in Python.

# 9. Use a profiler
# A profiler is a tool that measures the performance of your code and identifies
# bottlenecks and areas for optimization. By profiling your code, you can
# pinpoint which parts of your code are taking the most time to execute and
# optimize them for better performance. Some popular Python profilers include
# cProfile, line_profiler, and memory_profiler.

# 10. Use a debugger
# A debugger is a tool that allows you to inspect and manipulate the state of
# your program while it is running. You can set breakpoints, step through your
# code, and examine variables to debug issues in your code. The Python debugger
# (pdb) is a built-in debugger that you can use to debug your Python code.

# 11. Use a code coverage tool
# A code coverage tool is a tool that measures the percentage of your code that
# is executed by your tests. It can help you identify which parts of your code
# are not covered by tests and ensure that your tests are comprehensive. Some
# popular Python code coverage tools include coverage.py and pytest-cov.

# 12. Use a memory profiler
# A memory profiler is a tool that measures the memory usage of your code and
# identifies memory leaks and inefficient memory usage. By profiling the memory
# usage of your code, you can optimize memory usage and prevent memory leaks.
# Some popular Python memory profilers include memory_profiler and objgraph.

# 13. Use a static code analyzer
# A static code analyzer is a tool that analyzes your code without executing it
# and checks for potential errors, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.
# It can help you catch bugs early in the development process and improve the
# overall quality of your code. Some popular Python static code analyzers
# include pylint, flake8, and bandit.

# 14. Use a dependency checker
# A dependency checker is a tool that checks for security vulnerabilities and
# outdated dependencies in your project. By regularly scanning your project for
# vulnerabilities and updating your dependencies, you can ensure that your code
# is secure and up-to-date. Some popular Python dependency checkers include
# safety and pyup.

# 15. Use a code review process
# Code reviews are a process in which other developers review your code and
# provide feedback on its quality, correctness, and maintainability. By
# conducting code reviews, you can catch bugs, improve code quality, and share
# knowledge with your team. You can use tools like GitHub, GitLab, and
# Bitbucket to facilitate code reviews in your projects.

# 16. Use a continuous integration (CI) system
# A continuous integration (CI) system is a tool that automatically builds,
# tests, and deploys your code whenever you push changes to a repository. By
# using a CI system, you can catch bugs early, ensure that your code works as
# expected, and automate repetitive tasks in your development workflow. Some
# popular CI systems for Python projects include Travis CI, CircleCI, and
# GitHub Actions.

# 17. Use a code documentation tool
# A code documentation tool is a tool that generates documentation from your
# code comments and docstrings. By documenting your code, you can make it easier
# for others to understand and use your code. Some popular Python code
# documentation tools include Sphinx, pdoc, and pydoc.

# 18. Use a code snippet manager
# A code snippet manager is a tool that allows you to store and organize code
# snippets for reuse. By using a code snippet manager, you can save time and
# avoid duplicating code in your projects. Some popular code snippet managers
# include Gist, Pastebin, and CodePen.

# 19. Use a code search tool
# A code search tool is a tool that allows you to search for code snippets,
# libraries, and documentation across different repositories and websites. By
# using a code search tool, you can find solutions to common problems, learn
# new techniques, and discover useful resources for your projects. Some popular
# code search tools include GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Google.

# 20. Use a code sharing platform
# A code sharing platform is a platform that allows you to share code snippets,
# projects, and resources with others. By using a code sharing platform, you can
# collaborate with other developers, showcase your work, and contribute to the
# open-source community. Some popular code sharing platforms include GitHub,
# GitLab, and Bitbucket.

# 21. Use a code playground
# A code playground is an online platform that allows you to write, run, and
# share code snippets in the browser. By using a code playground, you can
# experiment with code, test ideas, and learn new programming languages and
# frameworks. Some popular code playgrounds include CodePen, JSFiddle, and
# Repl.it.
